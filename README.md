# CapstoneTeamIntro

This project will be making a simple calculator in java. 

It will have 3 features:
ADD (which adds 2 integers together)
SUBTRACT (which subtracts 2 integers from each other)
MULTIPLY (which multiplies 2 integers by each other)

Each team member will do one of these tasks. 

Each member is responsible to provide a test case for their code. 

This uses java version 11 and JUnit5.4

This is for testing Phil's ability to connect and show contribution to the repo

This is a new line to test pull requests and review
